Let's start with a small introduction.

## Obstacle to build a website

There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

- User Interface (UI)
- Routing
- Data Fetching
- Rendering
- Integrations
- Infrastructure
- Performance
- Scalability
- Developer Experience

For each of these aspects, developers can choose between building custom solutions or leveraging existing tools like libraries and frameworks.

## So what is React?

While JavaScript is the main programming platform for designing websites, Reactjs a JavaScript package that simplifies the construction of graphic user interfaces.

> JavaScript as the building blocks (like bricks and wood) used to construct a website. ReactJS is like a toolbox with pre-made components (like walls, doors, and windows) that make building the website's user interface (the visual part users interact with) much faster and easier. So you only need to use pre-made door, pre-made doors without creating from the scratch like in javascript. In other words its life safer for developers to build a website.

Using React we can use code like component so we can reuse the code where ever we want.

## What is Next.js?

Here we comes into Next js.

So Next js is A REACT FRAMEWORK that gives you building blocks to create web applications.

> Next.js is like having a helpful friend who can assist you with building your website. It provides additional features that make things easier and faster like routing, pre-rendering, SEO.

## Key take away:

1. Build a website has many obstacle so we need some tools to simplifies the process
2. React is a javascript package that simplifies the construction of Grapich User Interfaces
3. Next Js is a REACT FRAMEWORK that provides you additional features that make things easier and faster
